> With Obachine you can Build a custom search engine to search for books in the Amsterdam Public Library

## :book: Introduction
Obachine is a search engine made for the [Amsterdam Public Library (OBA)](https://oba.nl) and is mainly built for their younger age demographic. The purpose of this application is to educate them on the inner workings of a search engine where the outcome is based on the given inputs. However, it's also developed to enhance the quest of finding a book to read; making it easier and enjoyable.

It works by literally building the search query with using the machine blocks which are acting as search filters (i.e. author, genre).
