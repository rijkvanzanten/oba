# Obachine
[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/rijkvanzanten/obachine/branches/master/shields_badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/rijkvanzanten/obachine)

## Overview
Obachine is a search engine made for the [Amsterdam Public Library (OBA)](https://oba.nl) and is mainly built for their younger age demographic. The purpose of this application is to educate them on the inner workings of a search engine where the outcome is based on the given inputs. However, it's also developed to enhance the quest of finding a book to read; making it easier and enjoyable.

It works by literally building the search query with using the machine blocks which are acting as search filters (i.e. author, genre).

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS & JS
- [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org) w/
  - [Express](https://expressjs.com) webserver
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) automation

## Installation
Clone this repo
```bash
$ https://github.com/rijkvanzanten/obachine.git
```

and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

You will need a `.env` file in the root of your project which contains a public/secret keypair for the OBA API:
```
PUBLIC=1234567890
SECRET=1234567890
```

## Usage
- To use the app in development mode, use `npm start`
- To build the application use `npm run build`
- To test your JS use `npm run lint:js`
- To test your CSS use `npm run lint:style`

The last two commands are running within Webpack, but they are there if you want to use them besides Webpack.

### Writing commit messages
_Based on [**Chris Beams**](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) seven Rules of a great Git commit message._

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line.
1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
1. Do not end the subject line with a period.
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
1. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
